**Leukemia Classification Using Deep Learning and Grey Wolf Optimization**


This repository implements a novel approach for leukemia classification and hematologic malignancy detection. The system uses advanced image preprocessing, customized neural network models, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve state-of-the-art results. The code is developed in MATLAB and demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for leukemia image classification.

üìò **Project Overview**

Leukemia is a life-threatening cancer characterized by the abnormal growth of white blood cells. This project proposes a robust automatic framework for accurate leukemia detection using image processing and deep learning techniques. Key components of the solution include:
‚Ä¢	Customized CNN Model (PIDSAN4): A novel neural network architecture for efficient image classification.
‚Ä¢	Vision Transformer (ViT): Lightweight Tiny16 model for enhanced feature learning.
‚Ä¢	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized using Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) to improve model accuracy and performance.
‚Ä¢	Contrast Enhancement: Image preprocessing with hyperbolic sine and dehazing functions.
